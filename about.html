            <p>Founded in 2010, FurniCo started with a simple idea: that everyone deserves a home filled with furniture that is both beautiful and built to last. We were tired of the disposable, fast-furniture trend and wanted to bring back a sense of craftsmanship and permanence to the pieces we live with every day.</p>
            <p>We partner with skilled artisans who share our passion for quality materials and timeless design. From the initial sketch to the final polish, every item in our collection is crafted with care, attention to detail, and a commitment to sustainability. We believe that good design should be accessible, and we work hard to offer our curated pieces at a fair price.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being a part of our journey. We hope you find the perfect piece to complete your space.</p>
